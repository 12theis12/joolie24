00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.350
I can't tell you how excited I am to be

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.000
your one and only teacher for the front end Nanodegree program.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.365
This is going to be so.

00:00:09.365 --> 00:00:10.040
Hello.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.179
Hi. Who are you?

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.170
I'm Richard. Did you say you're the instructor for this program?

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.030
Well, yeah. I narrated the welcome introduction.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.054
Why wouldn't I be the one teaching too?

00:00:22.054 --> 00:00:24.379
Well, I'm teaching some of the courses.

00:00:24.379 --> 00:00:26.714
Wait, you're teaching?

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:28.039
What makes you qualified?

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.575
Let's see. I've been developing on the web for gosh! Well, over a decade.

00:00:33.575 --> 00:00:37.590
I've been teaching some of this stuff at the graduate level for several years.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
And I actually use this stuff every single day.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.335
All right, well, I guess we could both teach.

00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:49.980
The thing is that I've got this list of instructors here and I just don't see you on it.

00:00:49.979 --> 00:00:52.564
There's a list? Oh yeah,

00:00:52.564 --> 00:00:53.960
we've got a ton of great instructors.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.759
Hey there.

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:57.759
This is awkward.

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:59.726
And who are you?

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:02.424
My name is Andrew and I'm one of the other instructors here.

00:01:02.424 --> 00:01:04.549
Been developing on the web for a couple of

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.439
years now and I've also taught at a coding bootcamp.

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.060
Oh wow.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.159
Yeah, and that's just the two of us.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:13.219
We also have Mike.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:17.250
Mike has been working with the web since the early 90s.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.010
There's Cameron.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.350
Cameron has a master's in education and has been building websites for years.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:24.719
Julia.

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:28.189
And then there's James.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.420
And there's the other James.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.409
Okay, okay. I get it.

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.590
You've got a nice little team there.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.900
Look, you can come back every once in awhile.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.670
Just because this welcome part is over,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.799
doesn't mean you have to go away forever.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.609
Really? You mean that?

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:43.129
Of course.

00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:45.554
It's a relief.

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:49.100
I'm actually, well, I'm actually Excited for this.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:51.689
And we're excited to teach you.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.709
So welcome to the Front-End Nanodegree Program.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.689
Welcome. You want to take this last one?

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.530
