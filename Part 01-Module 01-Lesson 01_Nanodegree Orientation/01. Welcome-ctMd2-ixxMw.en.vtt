00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.411
But I think about this.

00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:06.540
And what about this internet thing? Do you know anything about that?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.589
Sure.

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.394
What the hell is that exactly?

00:00:11.394 --> 00:00:14.839
Well, it's become a place where people are publishing information.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:15.199
Right.

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:17.140
So, everybody can have their own home page,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.024
companies are there, the latest information.

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.084
It's wild what's going on.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:24.170
It is the big new thing.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.179
I think you're on to something, Bill.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.684
When the world wide web came along,

00:00:28.684 --> 00:00:32.653
it was the biggest thing since, well.

00:00:32.654 --> 00:00:36.520
From a humble beginning of static text in an,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.290
okay, we're moving fast.

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:40.179
Over the last 20 years,

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.604
the web has changed into a powerful platform that is now interactive,

00:00:44.604 --> 00:00:48.964
and I'll say it, even beautiful.

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:55.495
And it rapidly continues to grow and change every day.

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:58.474
After taking this Nanodegree Program,

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:02.260
you'll be prepared for endless opportunities as a web developer.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:03.570
Me too?

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.760
Of course. A year ago,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.180
I told Dan he'd be able to bring his small business online.

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:12.890
Built a site, and business is booming.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.245
Go, Dan.

00:01:15.245 --> 00:01:18.590
Sarah got a job as a Frontline Developer at,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.659
what's the name of that little Internet company again?

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:22.500
Google.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.209
Oh, yeah. Google. She builds websites her clients love.

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:28.559
We love it.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.879
And this guy got that promotion at work.

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:34.769
My parents are so proud.

00:01:34.769 --> 00:01:39.429
Before all of that, they learned the foundation of front-end web development,

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.510
and how to think like a programmer with Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree Program.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:50.225
So, welcome. You're joining something really special.

00:01:50.224 --> 00:01:55.099
Now, let's take a look at what you'll be building and learning.
