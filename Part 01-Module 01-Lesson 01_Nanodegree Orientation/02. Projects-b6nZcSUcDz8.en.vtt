00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Without front end-developers, this is what the web will look like.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.095
Pretty boring, right? No design.

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.664
No interaction. No good.

00:00:10.664 --> 00:00:14.035
Without modern front-end development,

00:00:14.035 --> 00:00:17.469
all of your favorite sites would be unrecognizable,

00:00:17.469 --> 00:00:25.189
Google, Facebook, that cat blog you secretly like.

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:29.580
With Udacity, you'll learn the foundational programming languages

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.109
of the web and build projects that will show off your new-found skills.

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.609
You'll start with HTML,

00:00:35.609 --> 00:00:40.784
the building block of every website, text, links, images.

00:00:40.784 --> 00:00:49.500
You'll then learn CSS so you can style your own website with layout, fonts and colors.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.170
Okay, too many colors.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.789
More and more of the web is being taken off the traditional computer screen and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.789
adapted for any number of other screen shapes and sizes.

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.879
You'll build a portfolio site that functions well and looks good on a phone,

00:01:08.879 --> 00:01:15.012
a TV and a fridge?

00:01:15.012 --> 00:01:20.159
Okay. Then we'll dive deep into the web's most popular programming language.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.739
You'll learn what's needed to get started and use

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:28.129
object-oriented JavaScript and the DOM in a creative way.

00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:31.299
With this understanding of JavaScript,

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.399
you'll have the ability to add amazing levels of interaction to,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.473
hold on, this does not look.

00:01:41.472 --> 00:01:43.420
This is embarrassing.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.725
One second.

00:01:45.724 --> 00:01:51.269
Throughout the process you'll learn how to troubleshoot and problem solve

00:01:51.269 --> 00:01:58.189
like a real programmer. I should do this and that.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.379
That should do it. And a little longer. There we go.

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.254
Finally, we'll get you comfortable with optimizing

00:02:13.254 --> 00:02:18.740
your websites and working with various APIs and different frameworks.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.465
The web is constantly changing and

00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:25.390
there are new and better tools popping up all the time.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.019
While we can't cover everything,

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.210
by the end of the program you'd be prepared to

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.661
build off of the foundations you learned here,

00:02:31.661 --> 00:02:35.920
and tackle all sorts of new technologies in the future.

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:38.259
We're excited for you to start.
